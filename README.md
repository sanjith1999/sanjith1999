ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sanjith

- I am looking for research opportunities related to computational imaging, sparse signal recovery, time series, and the idea of diffusion. Prefer mathematical side of it.
- I beleive the real beauty of Engineering happens only when we bring the ideas from paper to practice. I feel it very satisfying when I am there in the whole process.
