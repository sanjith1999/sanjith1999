- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sanjith
- I am very much interested in learing mathematical and physical facts which brought me naturally into Engineering. I am a super open-minded person in my field. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently in the third year of my undergraduate course in Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering.
- Currently I am focussing on research intern opportunities in Digital Design Architecture and Machine Learning.
