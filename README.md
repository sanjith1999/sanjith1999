ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sanjith

- I am a passionate problem solver looking for research opportunities related to computational imaging, sparse signal recovery using Plug and Play methods, time series, and diffusion based models. I would like to work mainly on mathematical side.
- I love challenging my brain and adding new dimensions to my knowledge.
